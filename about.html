                    <h1>Biography</h1>

                    <p style="color: oldlace"> Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish
                        former football manager and player who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is
                        considered one of the greatest managers of all time, and he has won more trophies than any other
                        manager in the history of football. Ferguson was the longest-tenured manager in “Man U” history
                        and led the club to more than 30 domestic and international titles, including 13 Premier League
                        championships, five Football Association (FA) Cup victories (1990, 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2004),
                        and two Champions League titles (1999 and 2008).</p>

                    <p style="color: oldlace"> After going three years without a league championship, United won five
                        Premier League titles in a seven-season span from 2006–07 to 2012–13, with a second Champions
                        League win in 2008. Ferguson retired at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season but stayed
                        on with Man U in a front-office role and as a club ambassador.</p>
